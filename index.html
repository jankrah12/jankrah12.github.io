              Videos are essential for my platforms and apps. They are used to showcase the apps, create marketing and social media content. To showcase my creative side, I got a subscription to Adobe After Effects. Since I do not make videos that often, it got rather expensive and I had to switch to a free alternative. Now I use BlackMagic Fusion for motion graphics and videos. Below are some of the videos I have created

                I was born in Ghana - a small West African country - and moved to the United States in 2004. In 2008, I graduated from Trinity University with a major in Mechanical Engineering. I am married with 2 beautiful kids. I would describe myself as half-nerd half-jock. Other interests I have include playing piano, photography, cooking and learning new things. This year I am learning Spanish. My dream is to travel to all the exotic places in the world

                  <p>I span up a few more servers and hired some freelancers to help with things like day-to-day administration, social media - oh and I also needed a system admin. That was the fun stuff. The not so fun stuff was all the legal and business stuff like setting up an LLC, taxes and accounting. In 2016 I had to make the decision to quit my job as a systems engineer. I developed a website to go along with the mobile apps. The site was developed from the ground up using HTML and javascript for frontend, php and mysql for backend. I also developed admin portals for managing things like approving user submissions and various automation tasks.</p>

                  <p>In 2018, I fell in love with React Native and decided to re-engineer my app using the the new technology. This was a huge undertaking but it provided me the benefit of developing a cross-platform app amongst other benefits. The biggest challenge was migrating data from native to React Native and making that transition seem-less for the users. In the end, the feedback I received was overwhelming positive and the apps are easier to monitor, debug and add features</p>

                  <p>So I designed a quick logo and UI and set out to to conquer the world. The backend was solely developed on Google Firebase because it quick and easy to get going. The app is loaded with features such as profile setup, dates and event setup and of course messaging. I got a simple website from Wix for this one and I was ready for launch. A big part of the project for me was learning how to launch and market an app platform.</p>

                  <p>So I sent out a press release, contacted a few sites and blogs. For marketing, I setup advertising campaigns on Facebook, Snapchat and Google. It was a fun experience and I learned lots of lessons. The biggest being that it takes a lot of money and more than a one-man-band to get traction in todays app market.</p>
